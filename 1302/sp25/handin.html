<h3>CSc 1302, Spring 2025, Handin Instructions</h3>
To submit your programs, you will perform the following two steps:
<ol>
<li> <b>STEP 1:</b>
Transfer your files from you local computer/laptop to your account on
the tinman.cs.gsu.edu server.
<!-- This can be done using a file transfer protocol (ftp) 
client software such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>.
Make sure you download and install the FileZilla Client. Also, please use port 22 when
connecting to the server.
<P--> To transfer your files from your local computer to your account on the server perform the following steps:
<P>
Open a Terminal/Powershell Window.
cd into the folder containing the files you want to submit. Then,
type the following command (replace userid with your campusid):
<pre>
sftp userid@tinman.cs.gsu.edu
</pre>
you will be asked for your password; type it in (you may have to say "yes" to a question before password).
once you see the sftp prompt, transfer the file as follows:
<pre>
put file1.py
</pre>
Then, make sure you exit the sftp program:
<pre>
exit
</pre>

<P>
<li> <b>STEP 2:</b>
On the Terminal or Powershell window on your local computer/laptop, 
you will connect to the tinman.cs.gsu.edu server using the following command:
<pre>
ssh userid@tinman.cs.gsu.edu
</pre>
You will be prompted for your account's password on tinman server, 
which you should provide. You should navigate (cd) to the proper folder on the server within
your home directory containing the program files that were transferred in Step 1. 
From here, you can submit all files using the following command:
<pre>
sudo handin1302 1 file1.py file2.py file3.pdf file4.txt
</pre>
<P>
This will prompt you for your tinman password. You should see one SUCCESS message 
for each file you submit.
Resubmissions are allowed under the same file name and the handin script will ask 
you whether you want to overwrite the old submission file.
<P>
NOTE: The 1 in the command refers to the assignment number. For assignment 2, this 
should be 2, and so on.
</ol>
<P> You may use the following command to "view" all your submissions for a 
particular assignment on the server:
<pre>
$ sudo handin1302 -list 1
</pre>
where the 1 in the command is the assignment number. This can be replaced by other
assignment numbers.

Sometimes the file transfer and ssh commands may not work if you are
connecting from outside the GSU network. If you encounter such a situation,
you should connect to Cisco VPN (<a href="https://technology.gsu.edu/technology-services/cybersecurity/virtual-private-network/">GSU VPN Download</a>) and then retry sftp and ssh steps.
